    Installed cameras on the carbon fiber winding system for hydrogen tanks to detect visual defects such as overlapping fibers, incorrect fiber angles, and tears.  
    Infrared cameras captured raw data from the heated resin-impregnated fibers. Image processing techniques enabled defect detection.
